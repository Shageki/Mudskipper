# Mudskipper
An extensible MUD engine in node.js

## Features (planned)
Mudskipper is an ongoing project. The following core features are intended to ship as part of the first few Alphas.

### Access via shell or webapp
Allow access via telnet client or a robust webapp with a number of quality of life enhancements.

### Move around a map
Create game worlds that are as simple or complex as you'd like. Nest areas, allow multiple entrances and exits, create portals - whatever you want.

### Dynamic combat
Hybrid turn based / realtime combat engine - gate it to descrete chunks of time per turn, allow players all the time they need, or remove turns completely and encourage frantic spamming.

### Object-Oriented all the way down
All game entities can inherent all properties. Create a sword that talks back, or an enemy that can be used as a club, or an item that grants a new ability.

### Procedurally inclined
Create procedurally generated areas that can be explored by players. Spice things up with points of interest that players can encounter with static layouts. Mix and match!

### Reputation and faction system
Allow players to gain and lose reputation with an interconnected network of factions. Allow actions to go unnoticed if no one is there to notice them, or give your NPCs Santa-vision to know who's been naughty.
